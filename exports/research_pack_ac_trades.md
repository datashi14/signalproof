# SignalProof Research Pack: Austin Clark (@AC_Trades)

**Reference ID:** SP-2026-002
**Context:** Verification of Trading Track Record & Process Claims
**Status:** INSUFFICIENT / CREDIBILITY ALERT

---

## 📄 Executive Summary

The subject, Austin Clark, claims a **4+ year** successful trading track record. While the account creation date (Jan 2022) is verified, SignalProof has identified **critical discrepancies** in audience authenticity and "Success" verification. Audit of the `@AC_Trades` profile reveals classic indicators of **Simulated Social Proof (Fake Followers)**, with engagement rates falling below 1% of the total follower base (~50 likes for 13.9K followers). Combined with a lack of third-party PnL verification, the overall credibility of the "Success" claim is downgraded to **CRITICAL RISK**.

## ⚠️ Contradictions & Gaps

### 🔴 Follower Integrity Audit: CRITICAL FAIL

- **Indicator:** 13.9K Followers vs. 49 Likes on Pinned Post (Verified Jan 11, 2026).
- **Analysis:** Participation rate of **0.35%**. Highly indicative of purchased followers or bot-simulated growth to create a false "Expert" persona.
- **Impact:** Significant downgrade to "Credibility" and "Expertise" categories. SignalProof score adjusted to "Low Confidence".

### 🔴 Lack of Public PnL Verification

- **Claim:** "Used successfully for 4+ years."
- **Category:** Credibility
- **Confidence:** Low (0.05)
- **Problem:** No verified brokerage proof (MyFxBook, etc.). Success is exclusively self-reported.
- **SSSP Path Cost:** 0.25 (Critical Penalty for lack of unhackable primary evidence).

## 🛠️ Next Steps for Reviewer

1. **Bot Audit**: Run `@AC_Trades` through a third-party follower audit tool (e.g., FollowerAudit).
2. **Engagement Pod Check**: Inspect replies for repetitive, generic success stories from low-quality accounts.
3. **Primary Proof**: Demand a live brokerage session or third-party verified track record before committing funds to any "process".
