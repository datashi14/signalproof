# SignalProof Research Pack: Senior Systems Architect (Anonymized)

**Reference ID:** SP-2026-001
**Context:** Verification of Production AI and Systems Claims
**Status:** COMPLETE (High-Risk Contradiction Found)

---

## 📄 Executive Summary

The subject shows verified technical expertise in Zero-Trust authentication and low-latency AI inference based on public code contributions. However, a **critical risk** was identified regarding leadership claims, where timeline mismatches suggest a discrepancy in tenure or team size responsibility.

## ✅ Verified Claims

### 1. Architected Zero-Trust Production Auth System

- **Category:** Systems Architecture
- **Confidence:** High (94%)
- **Evidence IDs:** [E1], [E2]
- **Snippet:** "Architected the migration from legacy REST to gRPC for the core checkout service, implementing MTLS and Zero-Trust principles." (Source: Public PR History)

### 2. Reduced AI Inference Latency by 40ms

- **Category:** Production AI
- **Confidence:** High (92%)
- **Evidence IDs:** [E3]
- **Snippet:** "Introduction of gRPC-based inference loops resulted in cold-boot times dropping from 200ms to 40ms." (Source: Verified Engineering Blog)

## ⚠️ Contradictions & Gaps

### Leadership Tenure Mismatch

- **Claim:** "Led Platform Team of 15 Engineers"
- **Category:** Leadership
- **Confidence:** Low (Conflict)
- **Problem:** Social profile claims leading 15 people from July 2023 - Present. However, a contemporaneous personal post references "moving into my first lead role next month with 3 direct reports."
- **SSSP Path Cost:** 0.85 (High Penalty)
