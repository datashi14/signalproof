# SignalProof Research Pack: Retail Trading Influencer (Anonymized)

**Reference ID:** SP-2026-002
**Context:** Verification of Trading Track Record & Performance Claims
**Status:** INSUFFICIENT / CREDIBILITY ALERT

---

## 📄 Executive Summary

The subject claims a **4+ year** successful trading track record. While brand longevity is confirmed via account verification, SignalProof has identified **critical discrepancies** in audience authenticity and primary evidence. Audit reveals classic indicators of **Simulated Social Proof**, with engagement rates falling below 0.5% of the total follower base. Combined with a lack of third-party verified P\&L, the overall credibility of the "Success" claim is downgraded to **CRITICAL RISK**.

## ✅ Verified Claims

### 1. Brand Duration (4 Years)

- **Category:** Experience
- **Confidence:** Med (0.45)
- **Evidence IDs:** [E1], [E2]
- **Snippet:** Primary social media account creation verified for January 2022.
- **Note:** Timeline is verified, but integrity is significantly compromised by audience quality indicators.

---

## ⚠️ Contradictions & Gaps

### 🔴 Follower Integrity Audit: CRITICAL FAIL

- **Indicator:** ~14K Followers vs. <50 Likes on high-visibility posts.
- **Analysis:** Interaction rate of **0.35%**. Highly indicative of purchased followers or bot-simulated growth to create a false "Expert" persona.
- **Impact:** Significant downgrade to "Credibility" and "Expertise" categories.

### 🔴 Lack of Public PnL Verification

- **Claim:** "Used successfully for 4+ years."
- **Category:** Credibility
- **Confidence:** Low (0.05)
- **Problem:** No verified brokerage proof (MyFxBook, etc.). Success is exclusively self-reported.
- **SSSP Path Cost:** 0.25 (Critical Penalty for lack of unhackable primary evidence source).
